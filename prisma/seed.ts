                    <h3>Suffering</h3>
                    <p>The Buddha, after years of spiritual searching and contemplation, reached a core insight known as the First Noble Truth: "Life is Suffering." Not in a cynical sense, but in a deeply human one.</p>

                    <p>Suffering, dukkha, is part of every life, from physical pain to emotional wounds, from longing to loss, from uncertainty to impermanence. The Buddha didn't just theorize this. He observed it, lived it, and understood that until we acknowledge suffering, we can't transcend it.</p>

                    <p>So we begin here, with honesty and explore your hidden suffering.</p>`,

- Wounds from the past that still influence their present
- Ways they might be avoiding certain emotions or experiences

Be empathetic and non-judgmental. Help them see that acknowledging suffering is not wallowing - it's the first step toward greater self-awareness and compassion. Encourage them to be honest about what they find, and remind them that everyone carries suffering; it's part of the human experience.
